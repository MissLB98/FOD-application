				<h2>2. Technical Requirements</h2>
				
				<div>
					<h3>2.1 Website</h3>
					<p>You can go to the website <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>
					<p>There are three forms of this website. Mobile, desktop and app. I will analyse the desktop version.</p>
					
					<div class="critique clearfix">
						<h3>Layout and Structure</h3>
						
						<a class="fanficimg" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/" target="_blank"><img src="img/fanfiction.net1.jpg" alt="screenshot of fanfiction.net"/></a>
						<p>The desktop version of the website was not designed to be responsive to changing width sizes which kind of hinders you if you want to make the browser window smaller.</p>
						<p>The style is very simple and uses dark and light blue accents to differentiate between containers.</p>
						<p>Everything looks well organised and divided into categories. The genre and story links are seperated into columns.</p>
						
						<p>The news feed articles and Tweets are displayed with JSON using an API. No images are used to decorate the site that I know of except for your profile picture and story cover art.</p>
						<p></p>
						
						
						<h3>Why is this website great?</h3>
						
						<a class="fanficimg" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/anime/" target="_blank"><img src="img/fanfiction.net3.jpg" alt="screenshot of fanfiction.net"/></a>
						<p>When you watch a tv-show or read a book, have you ever wished that the characters did anything different or that the plot was different?</p>
						<p>Fanfiction.net has an enormous collection of fanfics written by people who want to explore that ‘what if’.</p>
						<p>It’s simple, free to use and accessible to nearly anyone.</p>
						<p>The community has a good mix of novice and professional writers. I have found stories that are amazing and scarily close to the real thing or even better.</p>
						
						<h3>Is there room for improvement?</h3>
						<p>Unfortunately, yes.</p>
						<p>The design is too simple and lacking. </p>
						<p>If you compare it to a platform like <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/">Wattpad</a>, you can see that more effort could have been put into making it more visually appealing.</p>
						
						<h3>Is navigation easy to use?</h3>
						<a class="fanficimg" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/anime/Fairy-Tail/" target="_blank"><img src="img/fanfiction.net4.png" alt="screenshot of fanfiction.net"/></a>
						<p>Fairly easy and understandable as everything is organised into categories upon sub-categories and manageable.</p>
						
						<h3>Is information easy to find?</h3>
						<p>Yes. It has a search input and detailed filter.</p>
						
						<h3>What parts of this site are fun and what parts are frustrating?</h3>
						
						<a class="fanficimg" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/signup.php" target="_blank"><img src="img/fanfiction.net2.jpg" alt="screenshot of fanfiction.net"/></a>
						<p>It’s fun posting your own fanfics, participating in forums and finding that story that is gold amongst the coal.</p>
						<p>The frustrating part is that sometimes authors abandon their stories and leave it incomplete.</p>
